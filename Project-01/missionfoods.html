                Food can be distinguished as one of the great
                connectors of different cultures. Despite being
                the same country, my areas in Mindanao opened
                me to tastes I have never known before. What 
                makes it more special for me is the people I 
                shared these memories with.

                    My companions and I are eating Adobo. But this is not
                    your ordinary Adobo. What we are eating are Frog legs
                    Adobo. What they say is true, it tastes like chicken,
                    except for the part that it is bony.

                    Provinces are graced with coconut trees. Some of the
                    members I work with own one, so they fed us. Coconut
                    straight from the tree tastes heavenly. The natural
                    coconut water really refreshes my soul and the coconut 
                    meat: a delicacy!

                    In Japan, they have these riceballs called Onigiri.
                    In the Philippines, our version of it is called 
                    Pastil. I will not learn that if I had not served
                    my mission! Pastil is rice topped with shredded meat,
                    either pork or chicken, and covered in banana leaves.
                    Pastil is everyone's go-to lunch in Mati.
