            Hi! This website is dedicated in sharing some of my fondest memories in the mission field.
            I have served in the Philippines Butuan Mission from July 2019 to July 2021. 
            Yes, you've read that right... I was on the mission field when year 2020 came, when the 
            COVID-19 pandemic swept globally. It may be hard during those times, but I thank our 
            Heavenly Father for that humbling experience that made me who I am today. Thus, I want
            to share with you some places that left impact on me on my missionary service.
