                Welcome to Davao Oriental! In a city called Mati, this
                is where I spent my last 6 weeks on the mission field.
                It is a city by the bay, what more can I ask for? Probably,
                an extension in my service because not just the place 
                is good but the people here are better! It is here where I
                truly savor for the last time what it means to have a 
                name badge, to serve God with all your might, mind, and strength.

                    This is Dahican Beach, home to the surfing capital of 
                    Davao Oriental province. Of course, my companion and 
                    district mates went to check it out! Its crystal blue 
                    water and white sand feels similar to the beaches here 
                    in Hawaii.

                    Davao Oriental get to showcase their rich culture through
                    their museum, Subangan. They display here the remains of a 
                    sperm whale that is washed ashore in one of the province's
                    town. They affectionately called it, Davor, which came from
                    the province's first syllables.
