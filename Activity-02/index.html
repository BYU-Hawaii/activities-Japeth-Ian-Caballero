        <p>
            Hi! My name is Japeth and I'm trying my best to learn 
            <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, 
            <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, & 
            JavaScript this Spring 2024 semester here at 
            <abbr title="Brigham Young University-Hawaii">BYUH</abbr>. 
            Our professor is Justin Marshall, and he is good at 
            mentoring us in learning these things.

        <h3>Why?!</h3>
        <p>
            I don't know... I am majoring in Mathematics with an 
            emphasis in Applied Mathematics. I'm taking up several
            minors and certificates as well (because of the Holokai 
            program requirement) which are <abbr title="Information Technology">
            IT</abbr>, Computer Science, Linguistics, and Digital Business.
