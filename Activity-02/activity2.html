        <p>6:30 AM - The Struggle of Waking Up My alarm goes off, and I hit snooze a couple of times before finally dragging myself out of bed. I’m not a morning person, but my 8 AM calculus class waits for no one.</p>
        <p>7:15 AM - A Quick Bite I grab a banana and a granola bar because who has time to cook? I check my backpack to make sure I’ve got my calculator and textbooks – they’re basically extensions of my arms now.</p>
        <p>8:00 AM - Calculus Conundrums I make it to class on time (barely) and settle in for a lecture on integrals. I’m following along until we hit a particularly tough example. I jot down a note to ask my professor about it later.</p>
        <p>10:00 AM - Library Time No classes now, so I head to the library. I’ve got a midterm coming up, so I spend a couple of hours reviewing notes and doing practice problems. I’m pretty sure the librarians know me by name at this point.</p>
        <p>12:00 PM - Lunch and Laughs I meet up with some friends from my study group for lunch. We talk about our classes, sure, but we also take the time to just laugh and catch up on non-math-related life.</p>
        <p>1:30 PM - Afternoon Lectures Back to back classes after lunch. First up is statistics, followed by a seminar on mathematical modeling. It’s a lot to take in, but I’m genuinely interested in seeing how these theories apply to real-world problems.</p>
        <p>4:00 PM - Office Hours I swing by my calculus professor’s office to ask about that tricky integral from this morning. Turns out, I was overthinking it. We go through it step by step, and it clicks.</p>
        <p>5:30 PM - A Much-Needed Break I hit the campus gym. Running on the treadmill is my way of zoning out. Plus, it’s a good balance for all the sitting I do during lectures.</p>
        <p>7:00 PM - Dinner and Downtime I cook some pasta for dinner – it’s cheap, easy, and fills me up. Then I spend some time scrolling through social media and watching a show to unwind.</p>
        <p>9:00 PM - Evening Study Session I review my notes from today’s lectures and start on homework. I’m part of a group chat where we help each other out with assignments, and it’s a lifesaver.</p>
        <p> 11:00 PM - Nightcap Before bed, I spend a little time on my hobby – I’m teaching myself to code. It’s challenging, but I like how it’s a different way of problem-solving compared to my math classes.</p>
        <p>12:00 AM - Lights Out I set my alarm for the next day, hoping I’ll be more willing to get up when it rings. Then it’s off to sleep, ready to do it all over again tomorrow.</p>
