                    Welcome to Davao del Norte! This is where I spend my 6th transfer.
                    Some places are just recovering from the pandemic, and this place
                    is no exception. Davao del Norte is the province but I was assigned
                    in Delfina branch and Mankilam branch of Tagum City, and Kapalong branch.
                    Yes, I handled 3 branches simultaneously due to lack of missionaries.
                    Despite that, I was assigned to a companion who I was close with
                    before, and that made the work fun. After all, we did get to baptize
                    two individuals that time.

                        This is a hanging bridge in a place called Mesaoy.
                        I still remember how shaky this bridge is, and 
                        how dizzy I felt crossing that!

                        This is another town that is part of Delfina branch, called 
                        New Corella. If I'm being honest, the provincial environment
                        of this place makes me want to purchase a land and retire here.
