                    Welcome to Surigao del Norte! In this province lies my 3rd area, 
                    the town of Tubod. 'Tubod' means 'Spring' in Cebuano, which is why
                    there are a lot of hidden springs in this town that I get to see
                    when my companions and I go tracting. Did I say 'companions'? Oh yeah, 
                    I stayed in this town for 9 months, so I get to have 3 companions 
                    while serving in this area. I mean, this is where I got stuck when the 
                    pandemic came. Still, reminiscing about this town help me realize
                    the tender mercies I receive from the Lord.

                        This is Lumondo Falls! It is part of Alegria, another town in 
                        Surigao del Norte. We went here for a district activity.

                        This is Tubod! My companion and I found a shortcut with 
                        this beautiful scenery. So we took our chances and took 
                        some cool pictures, like this one.
